  In the modern day circuit boards, the CHIP is placed on the board and provided connection with different peripherals

  A program is compiled and converted to machine level language program which is understood by the hardware. Finally, it generates the GDSII output

#### Package

* In any embedded board we have seen, the part of the board we consider as the chip is only the ***PACKAGE*** of the chip which is nothing but a protective layer or packet bound over the actual chip and the actual manufatured chip is usually present at the center of a package wherein, the connections from package is fed to the chip by ***WIRE BOUND*** method which is none other than basic wired connection.
